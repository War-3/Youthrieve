            <h1>Google Search Ranks AI Spam Above Original Reporting in News Results</h1>
        
            <h3>
                Google adjusted its policies to target AI spam earlier this year, but plagiarizing content still 
                comes up higher in search results months later—and SEO experts 
                aren’t sure why.
            </h3>
            <p>
                RECENTLY, I WAS using Google and stumbled upon an article that felt eerily familiar.
            </p>
            <p>While searching for the latest information on Adobe’s artificial intelligence policies, 
                I typed “adobe train ai content” into Google and switched over to the News tab. 
                I had already seen WIRED’s coverage that appeared on the results page in the second 
                position: “Adobe Says It Won’t Train AI Using Artists’ Work. Creatives Aren’t Convinced.”
