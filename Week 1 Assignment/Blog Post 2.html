                The software engineer’s cautionary Web3 blog pours cold water on cryptocurrency’s dumpster fires.
            </h3>
            <p>
                White started the blog in December 2021 out of frustration with the mainstream coverage of crypto, 
                which she says paid too much attention to rags-to-riches tales and not enough to its dark underbelly.
